# Futbolín
This is Futbolín, a table football competition system.
Futbolín is also the Spanish name of the table football.
Why Spanish?
Because one of the inventors of table football was a Spaniard, [Alejandro Finisterre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Finisterre).

Current state is an empty sheet: I'm planning to learn a bit about developing software with .NET using the [.NET Microservices. Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/index) e-book.
Since I like the game I figured it might be a fun project to embark on.
At least its something different from the [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers) used througout the book.
